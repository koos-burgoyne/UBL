This dataset is made up of three fasta files:
    - pos-ubl.fa: protein sequences that are identified as being a ubiquitin ligase
    - neg-uniprot.fa: random sequences from uniprot that are not identified as ubiquitin ligases
    - neg-zinc-finger.fa: protein sequences that are not ubiquitin ligases, but have a "zinc finger"
    - pos_neg-unip.fa: protein sequences from pos-ubl.fa and neg-uniprot.fa
    - pos_neg.fa: all protein sequences from the first three files - protein sequences that are identified as UBL and those that are not, including the zinc finger sequences for false positive testing

The zinc finger sequences are supposed to be something of a false positive trap.
