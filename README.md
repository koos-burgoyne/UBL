### Ubiquitin Ligase Classification

This is a work in progress. So far I am working on data formatting in data_format.py and have the testing for this embedded on UBL.py. 

I am working on implementing a 2d Conultional Neural Network (in the notebook 2D_CNN.ipynb) to classify UBL proteins in contrast to a set of other non-UBL proteins, and hopefully thereafter to a set of known false-positive non-UBLs.

More info coming soon...
